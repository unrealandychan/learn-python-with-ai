# Lesson 5: Control Flow: Conditional Statements

# Instructions:

# 1. Ask the user to enter their score on a test.
# 2. Convert the score to an integer.
# 3. Use an `if-elif-else` chain to print the grade:
#    - 90 or above: "A"
#    - 80-89: "B"
#    - 70-79: "C"
#    - 60-69: "D"
#    - Below 60: "F"
# 4. Write a separate `if` statement to give an encouraging message if the score is below 70.
