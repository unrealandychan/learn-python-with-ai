# Lesson 18: Error Handling (Try/Except)

# Instructions:

# 1. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers.
# 2. Use a `try...except` block to handle two potential errors:
#    a) `ValueError`: If the user enters text instead of a number.
#    b) `ZeroDivisionError`: If the user enters 0 for the second number.
# 3. If the division is successful, print the result.
# 4. If an error occurs, print a user-friendly message.
