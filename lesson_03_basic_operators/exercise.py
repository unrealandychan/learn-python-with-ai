# Lesson 3: Basic Operators

# Instructions:

# 1. Create two variables, `a` and `b`, with integer values.
# 2. Calculate and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
# 3. Use comparison operators to check if `a` is greater than `b` and print the result.
# 4. Use comparison operators to check if `a` is equal to `b` and print the result.
# 5. Use logical operators to check if `a` is positive AND `b` is positive. Print the result.
