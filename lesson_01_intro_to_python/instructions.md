# Lesson 01: Intro to Python

Welcome to your very first Python lesson! This is where your journey into programming begins.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. What does that mean?

*   **High-level:** You don't have to worry about low-level details like memory management. Python handles much of that for you, allowing you to focus on solving problems.
*   **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand. This makes development faster, as you can run your code immediately.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It's known for its readability and simplicity, often described as "executable pseudocode." Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace (indentation).

## Why Learn Python?

Python is incredibly popular and versatile. Here are a few reasons why it's a great language to learn:

*   **Easy to Learn:** Python's syntax is clear, concise, and very similar to natural language, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
*   **Versatile:** You can use Python for almost anything: web development (e.g., Django, Flask, FastAPI), data science and machine learning (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch), automation, scripting, game development, scientific computing, and much more.
*   **Large Community:** Python has a massive and active community. This means you're never alone if you encounter a problem; there are tons of resources, forums, and libraries available.
*   **Industry Demand:** Python is widely used in various industries, making it a valuable skill for many job roles.

## Your First Python Program: "Hello, World!"

The "Hello, World!" program is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It's a simple program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen. In Python, it's incredibly straightforward, requiring just one line of code.

### The `print()` function

The `print()` function is a built-in Python function that allows you to display output to the console (your terminal or command prompt). You will use this function constantly to see the results of your code, debug issues, and provide information to the user.

To use `print()`, you place the text or variable you want to display inside the parentheses. If you're printing text directly, you must enclose it in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

**Example:**

Let's see how to print "Hello, World!" and some other messages:

```python
# This line prints the classic greeting
print("Hello, World!")

# You can print other text too
print('Welcome to Python programming!')

# Each print statement, by default, adds a new line at the end
print("This is the first line.")
print("This is the second line.")
```

**How to run your Python code:**

1.  Open the `exercise.py` file in your code editor.
2.  Write your Python code in that file.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
5.  Navigate to the directory where your `exercise.py` file is located (e.g., `cd lesson_01_intro_to_python`).
6.  Run the file using the command: `python exercise.py`

You should see the output of your `print()` statements displayed in the terminal.

**Congratulations!** You've just written and executed your first Python program. This is a fundamental step in your programming journey.
